# Django TemplateDoesNotExist Fix

## Problem
Your Django app was throwing a `TemplateDoesNotExist` error for `index.html` when deployed to PythonAnywhere. This happened because:

1. Django was looking for the `index.html` template in the configured template directories
2. The template directory configuration had a conditional check that might fail in production
3. The static file paths in the HTML were not properly configured for Django's static file serving

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Django Settings (`backend/backend_project/settings.py`)
- Removed the conditional check for the frontend directory existence
- Added a fallback `templates` directory to the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` configuration
- Now Django will look for templates in both:
  - `backend/static/frontend/` (original location)
  - `backend/templates/` (fallback location)

### 2. Updated URL Configuration (`backend/backend_project/urls.py`)
- Removed the conditional check for frontend directory existence
- Ensured static file serving works consistently in both development and production

### 3. Created Template Directory and Fixed Paths
- Created `backend/templates/` directory
- Copied `index.html` to the templates directory
- Updated asset paths in the HTML to use Django's static file serving:
  - `/favicon.ico` → `/static/frontend/favicon.ico`
  - `/manifest.json` → `/static/frontend/manifest.json`
  - `/assets/...` → `/static/frontend/assets/...`

## Files Modified
1. `backend/backend_project/settings.py` - Updated template configuration
2. `backend/backend_project/urls.py` - Removed conditional frontend serving
3. `backend/templates/index.html` - Created with correct static paths

## Deployment Steps for PythonAnywhere

1. **Upload the modified files** to your PythonAnywhere account:
   - `backend/backend_project/settings.py`
   - `backend/backend_project/urls.py`
   - `backend/templates/index.html` (new file)

2. **Reload your web app**:
   - Go to the Web tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard
   - Click the "Reload" button for your web app

3. **Test the application**:
   - Visit https://progress.pythonanywhere.com/
   - The TemplateDoesNotExist error should be resolved

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Multiple Template Directories**: Django now has multiple places to look for the `index.html` template
2. **Correct Static Paths**: The HTML file now references static files using Django's static file serving URLs
3. **No Conditional Logic**: Removed conditions that might fail in different environments

## Verification
After deployment, you should see your React application load properly instead of the Django error page.
