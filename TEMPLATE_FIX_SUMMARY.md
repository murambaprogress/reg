# Django TemplateDoesNotExist Fix with Build Directory Fallback

## Problem
Your Django app was throwing a `TemplateDoesNotExist` error for `index.html` when deployed to PythonAnywhere. This happened because:

1. Django was looking for the `index.html` template in the configured template directories
2. The template directory configuration had a conditional check that might fail in production
3. The static file paths in the HTML were not properly configured for Django's static file serving

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Django Settings (`backend/backend_project/settings.py`)
- Removed the conditional check for the frontend directory existence
- Added multiple fallback directories to the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` configuration
- Added build directory to `STATICFILES_DIRS` for fallback static files
- Now Django will look for templates in:
  - `backend/static/frontend/` (primary location)
  - `backend/templates/` (secondary location)
  - `build/` (fallback location - root build directory)

### 2. Updated URL Configuration (`backend/backend_project/urls.py`)
- Removed the conditional check for frontend directory existence
- Added fallback static file serving from build directory
- Added routes for build assets, favicon, manifest, and robots.txt
- Implemented SmartFrontendView for intelligent template selection

### 3. Created Smart Frontend System
- Created `backend/api/frontend_views.py` with `SmartFrontendView`
- Smart view automatically detects available templates and static files
- Falls back gracefully between different frontend configurations
- Created multiple template versions:
  - `backend/templates/index.html` - Uses `/static/frontend/assets/...`
  - `backend/templates/index-build-fallback.html` - Uses `/build-assets/...`

### 4. Enhanced Static File Serving
- Primary: `/assets/...` → `backend/static/frontend/assets/...`
- Fallback: `/build-assets/...` → `build/assets/...`
- Direct serving of favicon.ico, manifest.json, robots.txt from build directory

## Files Modified
1. `backend/backend_project/settings.py` - Enhanced template and static file configuration
2. `backend/backend_project/urls.py` - Added smart frontend view and fallback routes
3. `backend/templates/index.html` - Created with Django static paths
4. `backend/templates/index-build-fallback.html` - Created with build directory paths
5. `backend/api/frontend_views.py` - New smart frontend view with automatic fallback

## Deployment Steps for PythonAnywhere

1. **Upload the modified files** to your PythonAnywhere account:
   - `backend/backend_project/settings.py`
   - `backend/backend_project/urls.py`
   - `backend/templates/index.html` (new file)

2. **Reload your web app**:
   - Go to the Web tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard
   - Click the "Reload" button for your web app

3. **Test the application**:
   - Visit https://progress.pythonanywhere.com/
   - The TemplateDoesNotExist error should be resolved

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Multiple Template Directories**: Django now has multiple places to look for the `index.html` template
2. **Correct Static Paths**: The HTML file now references static files using Django's static file serving URLs
3. **No Conditional Logic**: Removed conditions that might fail in different environments

## Verification
After deployment, you should see your React application load properly instead of the Django error page.
